# Mail-Client
Hello! My name is Tyler Langtimm, and this is a simple program that allows users to send an email message using SMTP.</br>
**Currently, this program doesn't function entirely properly.**</br>
Hopefully this will be fixed within a few days, but for the moment I am out of time to bug fix. Hopefully my professor or one of my classmates would be willing to show me where its going wrong.</br>
</br>
The vast majority of this code was provided for me in the lab, from Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach 6th Edition by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross.</br>

Special thanks also go out to the community at StackExchange for their ever helpful troubleshooting forums, as well as the excellent documentation provided by Oracle.
